Lifecycle hooks

Mount              Update               Unmount
--------        ----------              --------
constructor
render             render     
componentDidMount  componentDidUpdate     componentWillUnmount

figure: few important life cycle hooks
Note: if we ned lifecycle hooks we need class component 
rather than stateless functional component. We only use 
lifecycle hooks with class component

Mount phase:
Note: In Mount lifecycle hook: after constructor() render() is called 
and render() is called recursively i.e. all its component are 
rendered first and then the call moves to componentDidMount()

Update phase:
this phase is triggered when and element is changed in element tree of react.

Unmount:
This phase is called when and element is removed
componentWillUnmount() is called just before and element is removed
